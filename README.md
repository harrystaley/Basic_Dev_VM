# Basic_Dev_VM

## Overview

Basic_Dev_VM is designed to simplify the setup process for developers by providing a pre-configured virtual machine (VM) that includes all the essential tools and configurations necessary for a productive development environment. This project aims to minimize the time and effort required to configure a development environment, allowing developers to focus on coding right away.

### Project Structure

The Basic_Dev_VM repository includes the following key components:

- **Vagrantfile**: The main configuration file used by Vagrant to set up the virtual machine according to the specifications provided.
- **Scripts/**: This directory contains all the necessary scripts to install and configure the various tools and software within the VM.
- **Docs/**: Documentation files that provide additional information and guidance on using the virtual machine.
- **Tools/**: A directory with setup files or scripts for various development tools and utilities that will be pre-installed in the VM.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you can use Basic_Dev_VM, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Vagrant**: An open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments.
- **VirtualBox**: A free and open-source hosted hypervisor for x86 virtualization.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install VirtualBox**:
   - Download and install VirtualBox from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
   
2. **Install Vagrant**:
   - Download and install Vagrant from [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads).

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Basic_Dev_VM.git
     ```

4. **Start the Virtual Machine**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository and run:
     ```
     cd Basic_Dev_VM
     vagrant up
     ```

## Usage

Once the virtual machine is up and running, you can access it by running:

```
vagrant ssh
```

This command logs you into the virtual machine. Inside, you will find all the tools and configurations already set up as per the scripts in the `Scripts/` directory.

### Example Workflow

- Start the VM: `vagrant up`
- SSH into the VM: `vagrant ssh`
- Begin your development work within the VM environment.
- Once finished, you can halt the VM by running: `vagrant halt`
